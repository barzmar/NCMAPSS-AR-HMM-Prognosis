---

Project consists of:

1. ~~Data download~~ 
2. ~~ Data selection ~~ 
3. Data pre-processing 
4. AR/ARIMAX estimation/~~ Model Order Selection~~ 
5. Calculate scalar feature for estimating RUL (~~ Itakuro Saito~~ )
6. Clustering based on RUL
7. Define HMM (Hidden Markov Model)
8. Online estimation
